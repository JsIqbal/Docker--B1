the technology to create ram and hard drive are totally different

human branin has 2 parts:

1. analysis part of the brain and
2. storage part of the brain.

all the experience that a human brain have are never lost from the brain.
Like:

1. all the things seen by the eye are stored.
2. all the sounds heard from the ear are never lost. they are stored in the storage part of the brain.

workflow of the storage and analysis part of the brain works simultaneously together forming a system:

suppose that there is a new information named # and it is not being used anymore then thi information will be replaced with more prioritiezed information like $.

Ater a certain period of time the # information will be in so deep of the human brain that it will be hard to come by but it is still there.

the brain is never dull.

when you are asleep then the brain's analysis part takes a scan of all the information of the brain.

like it starts moving from a recent state to the deepest part of the brain.

## cpu -> registers -> cache memory -> main memory -> secondary memory

a register is a single cell which contains same number of bits as the ram in the computer. so if a ram's cell can contain 8 bit then the cpu's register set will have a cell memory of 8 bits.

a computers designation like 16 bit / 32 bit / 64 bit is assumed by the memory of register set.
if a register set's memory cell is 64 bit then it is a 64 bit computer.

computer can only execute binary files

cpu jokhon prothom there shesh porjonto execute kore ekei bole process.

a treditional computer could not do 2 work simultaniously.

that's why scientists created a new concept named process and there should be an ending point of process

also this ending point is kept in the pcb or process control block

switching between process is called context switching

pcb's state is the screenshot of the register set and the screenshot will always be uniquely identified

process's state is kept in the process

process: unique id, name, cpu useage,
memory, disk read, disk write, code , many many things = kept in the pcb -> pcb is a state manager

a computer and a process are same thing that's why process is called virtual computer

computer gives us feel that all the programs are being executed at the same time. this concept is called concurency.
