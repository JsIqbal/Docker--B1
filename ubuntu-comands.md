In the example above, `d` stands for directory.

- `cd`: Changes the current directory
- `pwd`: Prints the present working directory

In Linux, every software is treated as a file. When something is installed in Linux, it is saved on the hard drive as a file.

Linux OS:

- CPU + memory + hard disk -> Kernel -> System calls -> Processes (e.g., Node.js or Chrome)

Processes communicate with hardware through system calls made to the kernel. The kernel acts as the OS.

sudo usermod -aG docker <username> - remove sudo comand from docker
